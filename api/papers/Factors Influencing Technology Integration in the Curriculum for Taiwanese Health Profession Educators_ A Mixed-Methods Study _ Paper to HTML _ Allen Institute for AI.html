            <p tabindex="0"> In this study, we explored the considerations and the influencing factors for the technological integration of educational curricula based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) framework for health profession educators (HPEs). A mixed methodology was used that included semi-structured interviews with 15 HPEs and an online TPCK survey with a randomly selected sample of 319 HPEs from 217 Taiwanese universities. Five themes emerged, namely, supplementing traditional teaching methods, improving immediate educator-student interactions, tracking the learning process and improving the record-keeping, keeping up with technological trends, and advancing professional learning objectives for different student needs. The presence of pre-existing platforms and inspiration from colleagues and students were facilitators, whereas the risk of technological problems and the need to invest extra time into the preparation process were impediments to technology integration in the curriculum. Of the online respondents (n = 210), 64.2% have integrated at least one technological method into their curriculum. The logistic regression model revealed that gender, prior knowledge regarding how to incorporate technology with teaching, high mean TPCK scores, and relevant school policies were significant predictors of technology integration in the curriculum. Based on these results, recommendations for development in the health profession included efforts to equip HPEs with TPCK, in order to integrate technology into the curriculum effectively.</p>

                    <p tabindex="0">In the 21st century, technology has been a primary driver of change in the lives of humans. Technology has even become a significant part of the school environment; in fact, educators use it every day. In order for tomorrow's health professionals to practice at the peak of their abilities, medical education must be attractive and innovative, moving beyond an entrenched curriculum and pedagogical approaches, to meet the needs and best develop the skills of a new generation of students <a href="#BIBREF0"  id="BIBREF0-1. Introduction-ref">[1,</a> <a href="#BIBREF1"  id="BIBREF1-1. Introduction-ref">2]</a> . Undoubtedly, preparing students for future challenges, in highly complex patient-care environments, invariably involves engaging students in collaborative work and real-world problem-solving through effective exploitation of information and communications technologies (ICT) <a href="#BIBREF2"  id="BIBREF2-1. Introduction-ref">[3]</a> . However, limited data are available regarding technology integration in the curriculum of health profession educators. </p>
                
            
                
                    <p tabindex="0">Technology plays an important role in helping students become active learners in the 21st century. Interaction and reflection support the student-educator exchange; and technology has created new and diverse methods for conducting these processes, supporting the learner-centered education in multiple ways <a href="#BIBREF3"  id="BIBREF3-1. Introduction-ref">[4]</a> . Technology integration is the use of technology tools in general content areas in education in order to allow students to apply computer and technology skills to learning and problem-solving <a href="#BIBREF4"  id="BIBREF4-1. Introduction-ref">[5]</a> . The integration of technology in curricula can involve web-based technologies, mobile devices and apps, computers, tablets, and multimedia, and may even include activities that are mediated entirely in the digital form or that employ a blend of digital activities <a href="#BIBREF5"  id="BIBREF5-1. Introduction-ref">[6]</a> . Today's medical and nursing students favor creative, active learning environments that integrate purposeful technology use <a href="#BIBREF6"  id="BIBREF6-1. Introduction-ref">[7,</a> <a href="#BIBREF7"  id="BIBREF7-1. Introduction-ref">8]</a> . Educational projects for health profession students demonstrate the wide variety of ways in which technology can enhance the student experience and ultimately improve patient care <a href="#BIBREF8"  id="BIBREF8-1. Introduction-ref">[9]</a> . Observations and data collected from a technologically integrated curriculum could help educators determine whether there is a correlation between technological integration and students' learning motivations and preferences <a href="#BIBREF9"  id="BIBREF9-1. Introduction-ref">[10]</a> . However, there are still some issues; such as the high cost of implementing and maintaining technology, safety for students and educators (bullying), problems with infrastructure, physical injury (repetitive strain injury), fairness, and equality [11] <a href="#BIBREF12"  id="BIBREF12-1. Introduction-ref">[12]</a> <a href="#BIBREF13"  id="BIBREF13-1. Introduction-ref">[13]</a> . </p>
                
            
                
                    <p tabindex="0">To effectively use technology to support learner-centered education, educators should have appropriate pedagogical, technological, and content-based knowledge, and should also understand the interaction between these categories of knowledge. For a variety of reasons-including, for example, a lack of time, technological skills, resources, and stakeholder demands <a href="#BIBREF14"  id="BIBREF14-1. Introduction-ref">[14]</a> , as well as the presence of competing work demands <a href="#BIBREF15"  id="BIBREF15-1. Introduction-ref">[15]</a> -health profession educators struggle to effectively implement technology in their curriculum. These educators may also lack motivation to integrate technology into medical education due the limited or complete lack of support from their institutions <a href="#BIBREF16"  id="BIBREF16-1. Introduction-ref">[16]</a> . Accordingly, it is clear that multiple variables affect technology integration. Literature on the subject has presented several models in which variables classified at the school and educator levels are explained in relation to one another. Variables at the educator level include gender, technological competence, subject competence, attitude, and technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) experience <a href="#BIBREF17"  id="BIBREF17-1. Introduction-ref">[17,</a> <a href="#BIBREF18"  id="BIBREF18-1. Introduction-ref">18]</a> , while a variable at the school level is executive enforcement, which has been found to be a significant factor related to an educator's implementation of technological integration. For a comprehensive understanding the factors related to technological integration for health profession educators, mixed methods research, using quantitative and qualitative approaches in tandem, provides a better understanding of research problems than using one approach alone <a href="#BIBREF19"  id="BIBREF19-1. Introduction-ref">[19]</a> . </p>
                
            
                
                    <p tabindex="0">Most of the literature on barriers to technology integration has been anchored in the theoretical framework provided by Ertmer <a href="#BIBREF20"  id="BIBREF20-1. Introduction-ref">[20]</a> , which classified technology integration barriers into first-and second-order barriers. First-order barriers are a lack of access to computers and software, insufficient time to plan instruction, and inadequate technical and administrative support. Second-order barriers are beliefs about teaching, beliefs about computers, established classroom practices, and unwillingness to change. In a recent study, it seems that new barriers to technology integration (believing that the top unit of an institution at which educators' work decides whether to engage in the process of technology integration, and accepting that there are several barriers to technology integration at all times) have been to found to emerge and other barriers (lack of technology resources) have been found to decrease <a href="#BIBREF21"  id="BIBREF21-1.

                    <p tabindex="0">A mixed method was used. Initially, a qualitative phase was used to collect the influencing factors of educators' adoption of technology into a curriculum, and then a quantitative phase was used to incorporate the results of qualitative data in the TPCK survey as influencing factors. The focus of the qualitative research was on the process, that is, how exactly TPCK is taught. In the development of the TPCK process, the HPEs' considerations regarding the process, what their attitudes are, how they have changed, what problems they have encountered, what they are confused about, what their feedback is, what their final results are, etc. Since there is no research on HPEs' TPCK, this mixed research was designed using qualitative research and then quantitative research. This can help to clarify whether HPEs have TPCK and its' influencing factors. Finally, we tested the three models to validate the findings of the mixed data. </p>

Content knowledge (CK) is knowledge about the actual subject matter that is to be learned or taught. Pedagogical knowledge (PK) is deep knowledge about the processes and practices or methods of teaching and learning and how it encompasses (among other things) overall educational purposes, values, and aims. Technology knowledge (TK) is knowledge about standard technologies, such as books, chalk, and blackboards, as well as more advanced technologies, such as the Internet and digital video. The key to successful teaching is that educators can effectively integrate the understanding of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Educators use the teaching process and teaching methods (pedagogical knowledge, PK) to transform the content knowledge (CK) into the content that students can understand and learn. At the same time, students use their own cognitive levels, motivations, and interests to transform, adjust, and characterize the subject content <a href="#BIBREF24"  id="BIBREF24-2.1. Theoretical Framework-ref">[24]</a> . Subsequently, Mishra and Koehler <a href="#BIBREF25"  id="BIBREF25-2.1. Theoretical Framework-ref">[25]</a> have added the knowledge of technology (TK) into PCK by emphasizing the connections, interactions, affordances, and constraints between and among CK, PK, and TK. There are three ways that these forms of knowledge intersect: pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), technological content knowledge (TCK), and technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) ( <a href="#FIGREF0"  id="FIGREF0-2.1. Theoretical Framework-ref">Figure 1</a> ). Taken together, they intersect to become technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK or TPACK) as a conceptual framework to describe the knowledge base educators need to teach effectively with technology. Quantitative studies using structural equation modeling have found that six aspects of the TPACK framework-namely, TK, CK, PK, TCK, PCK, and TPK-are significant contributors to educators' self-reported efficacy for TPACK <a href="#BIBREF26"  id="BIBREF26-2.1.

However, the results of a study that reviewed the empirical TPACK studies, published in previous journals from 2002 to 2011, revealed that university or college educators were the least frequently used research samples in TPCK studies, and that health profession educators (HPEs) were never the subjects of TPCK studies. </p>

All the transcribed textual data were broken down by sentences as the unit of analysis so that syntactical differences, rather than semantic differences, were used to identify the textual units. The researchers first coded the transcriptions independently and then sorted the codes to identify common themes in the data using Burnard's <a href="#BIBREF31"  id="BIBREF31-2.5.1.

Furthermore, the researchers adopted an inductive approach to analyze the data, making use of a "constant comparison" method, and related open and axial coding techniques in which the emerging concepts were firmly grounded in the collected data. At the end of the analysis, five themes regarding how technology has been used in the curriculum development were strongly supported by the narrative data.

It is through these labs that educators can observe the students' learning progress to confirm whether the students have achieved the learning goals. These labs enable educators to interact with students and immediately discuss subsequent steps with the students in the classroom. These outcomes could not be achieved without technical assistance. Technology permits educators to adjust teaching strategies according to students' responses at any time in the classroom, through interactive response systems (IRSs) or social media, thus providing real-time feedback to understand how students process and react to the content. </p>

If my students have any questions, I can immediately post literature on LINE (an instant messaging app) to respond [to] their question and allow them to read immediately and express feedback. What responses I need to give depends on the reaction of the students, and I can make adjustments at any time (an educator in a department of hospital management, 1003-11). </p>

                    <p tabindex="0">Educators realize that technology is a modern trend. Furthermore, educational technology is not the only aspect of our lives that is becoming digitized, as various other aspects of our lives are also deeply connected to technology. When educators see students constantly engaged with technological products, they fear that if they do not keep up with technological trends, their educational methods will become irrelevant and ineffective. </p>

                    <p tabindex="0">During the interviews, the educators commented that, at any given level, the content that students are expected to learn as presented in the classroom is different from what the students will experience in clinical practice. In order to simultaneously deliver the content knowledge required for professional development and meet each student's particular learning needs, the educators attempt to integrate technology into the curriculum to enhance the effectiveness of the educational experience. An educator teaching pediatrics nursing stated: </p>
                
            
                
                    <p tabindex="0">You know that two-year University of Technology students were licensed staff and had care experience in paediatrics, gained from 5 years of junior college. They ([the] students) could not [be] satisfied by attending a classroom-oriented course alone. I try to provide the opportunity to them [to] experience[e] actual cases in paediatrics. So, I use 3D avatars (three-dimensional animation) with high-fidelity and hands-on learning activities to allow them to practice repeatedly and formulate a process for each skill (an educator in a nursing department, 1001-35). </p>

                    <p tabindex="0">More and more universities are emphasizing technology integration in their curriculum. One common method for technology integration is by establishing university-wide e-learning platforms.

                    <p tabindex="0">Our university uses the XXX platform, which allows us to store course data, exams, and homework. This way, all course material is electronic, and I don't have to look for an appropriate platform myself. It's easy for us to get started, and eventually we get used to using technology to store course materials on the platform (an educator in a pharmacy department, 1003-67). </p>

                    <p tabindex="0">Health profession education requires that a team of educators hold professional discussions to prepare appropriate coursework. If an educator on the team is enthusiastic about using educational technology, his/her experience could be an influencing factor in helping to motivate educators who are less enthusiastic about using the technology. This is especially the case if the experienced educator explains the process or method clearly. This positive experience may inspire other educators with less technological experience to try to make an effort to integrate technology into the curriculum. </p>
                
            
                
                    <p tabindex="0">At the beginning, I didn't want to use it, but one of the paediatrics instructors in our group was very interested in using technology. Because we had to prepare units together, we often heard him talk about how to use technology, and it seem[ed] not difficult. So, I also want to say that we should be using it (an educator in a nursing department, 1003-11). </p>

For model 2, which controlled for gender and academic degree, prior technological knowledge in teaching significantly influenced technology integration in curriculum and explained an additional 4.8% of the variance. Model 3 was adopted as the final model and explained a total of 73.6% of the variance to characterize the strong and significant influences of TPCK (OR = 3.50, 95% CI = 2.07-5.94) and school policy (OR = 4.59, 95% CI = 1.45-4.59) for technology integration in curriculum, which explained an additional 60% of the variance whereas the OR of learned technology (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.06-3.16) in teaching and academic degree decreased. Consequently, an HPE who possessed a bachelor's or master's degree, has learned technology in teaching, has higher scores in TPCK, and teaches in a school with an technology integration policy that was more likely to integrate technological methods in their curriculum.

Considerations Of Technology Integration Among Health Profession Educators-ref">[32]</a> . Our study indicated that the use of technology integration as a supplement to traditional teaching methods was the most common reason that HPEs integrated technology into their curriculum, while the Kirkwood and Price study revealed that 50% of technology integration interventions were used as supplementary activities in each curriculum. When educators initiate technology use for educational purposes, they tend to use it for education-centered activities to support traditional instructional applications. HPEs believed that technology integration might provide additional support and opportunities to help students learn under the constraints of traditional teaching. Moreover, with respect to integrating technology into a curriculum, the HPEs in the present study were interested in technology integration in order to enhance student motivation and encourage immediate interaction with students; these interests were consistent with those in previous studies <a href="#BIBREF33"  id="BIBREF33-4.1.

Similarly, Gaikwad and Tankhiwale <a href="#BIBREF34"  id="BIBREF34-4.1. Considerations Of Technology Integration Among Health Profession Educators-ref">[34]</a> mentioned that educators believe the convenience and flexibility of a technologically integrated curriculum allows them to adjust their teaching strategies depending on student input and participation. In this respect, educators could integrate technological methods to carry out effective instruction by considering multiple variables, such as student characteristics, subject area, classroom environment, and so forth that would be particularly helpful in the complex field of healthcare in which the health profession students must be able to face actual clinical situations. Thus, the ability of technology to simulate clinical situations and permit interactive decision-making fulfils educators' curriculum design goals <a href="#BIBREF2"  id="BIBREF2-4.1.

The Facilitating And Hindering Factors Of Technology Integration In Curriculum Among Educators-ref">[36]</a> . Time is required to produce material for technologically integrated courses; this is particularly the case for educators who are not familiar with the technology, which could, therefore, cause stress <a href="#BIBREF37"  id="BIBREF37-4.2. The Facilitating And Hindering Factors Of Technology Integration In Curriculum Among Educators-ref">[37]</a> . In the past, organizational support, which included training and the provision of technical resources and time, was an influencing factor related to whether educators would use a technologically integrated curriculum <a href="#BIBREF16"  id="BIBREF16-4.2.

As many studies have revealed, insufficient technical support, which caused educators to be less confident about technology integration, was also an impeding factor <a href="#BIBREF38"  id="BIBREF38-4.2. The Facilitating And Hindering Factors Of Technology Integration In Curriculum Among Educators-ref">[38]</a> . This information from prior studies supports the results of the present study because a convenient learning platform and training for those platforms already existed at the universities, which increased the motivation to use technology. </p>

                    <p tabindex="0">Consistent with the findings of an earlier study, gender is an influencing factor of educator technology integration <a href="#BIBREF3"  id="BIBREF3-4.3. The Influencing Factors Of Tpack In Considering Technology Integration-ref">[4]</a> . The suspected reason for this gender-based difference is that men are more accepting of technology than women. Therefore, male educators were more likely to integrate technology in a curriculum than female educators <a href="#BIBREF39"  id="BIBREF39-4.3. The Influencing Factors Of Tpack In Considering Technology Integration-ref">[39]</a> . </p>
                
            
                
                    <p tabindex="0">With respect to the educator's academic degree or education preparation level, prior studies have produced inconsistent findings. However, it is reasonable to assume that higher education, especially at the doctoral level of education for health professionals, focuses on the advancement of professional knowledge and theoretical development rather than strengthening its technological knowledge. HPEs in universities are experts who specialize in health-related subject matter and, ergo, may not have had any pedagogical or technological training before they became educators. Moreover, one of the responsibilities for educators in higher education is to participate in grant programs or studies. In contrast, bachelor's and master's level educators may be required to become more instruction-oriented, shifting a greater focus toward the integration of technology into the curriculum. </p>
                
            
                
                    <p tabindex="0">The number of years an educator has spent teaching does not affect the educator's technology integration <a href="#BIBREF17"  id="BIBREF17-4.3. The Influencing Factors Of Tpack In Considering Technology Integration-ref">[17]</a> . Instead, as we determined in our study, and as supported by the results of Koh et al. <a href="#BIBREF40"  id="BIBREF40-4.3. The Influencing Factors Of Tpack In Considering Technology Integration-ref">[40]</a> , the key factor for the successful integration of technology into a curriculum was whether or not educators had participated in technology training. However, when TPCK and school policies exist, gender influence disappears and the impact of learned technology also decreases, indicating that TPCK and school policy are the strongest factors affecting educator's technology integration. Undoubtedly, TPCK is the most important variable with regard to educators' technology integration, in our study as well as in previous studies <a href="#BIBREF3"  id="BIBREF3-4.3. The Influencing Factors Of Tpack In Considering Technology Integration-ref">[4,</a> <a href="#BIBREF42"  id="BIBREF42-4.3. The Influencing Factors Of Tpack In Considering Technology Integration-ref">41]</a> . Notably, in our findings, school policies that provide technological support and equipment were not only facilitators of integration, identified in the qualitative interviews, but also the strongest factor for technology integration based on the results of the online survey (see Hew and Tan <a href="#BIBREF43"  id="BIBREF43-4.3.

                    <p tabindex="0">Before coming to a close, we will discuss the response rate. From our nation-wide online sample, 32.3% HPEs submitted their online questionnaires.

                    <p tabindex="0">Due to the impact of technology on life and learning, educators must consider the maximum learning benefits of technological integration between student learning preferences and learning outcomes. We explored the considerations and the influencing factors for the technological integration of an educational curriculum based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) framework for HPEs. A mixed methodology was used, including semi-structured interviews and an online TPCK survey with a randomly selected sample from Taiwanese universities. Five themes emerged; namely, supplementing traditional teaching methods, improving immediate educator-student interaction, tracking the learning process and improving the record keeping, keeping up with technological trends, and advancing professional learning objectives for different student needs. The results found that gender was an influencing factor of educator technology integration. However, when TPCK and school policies existed, gender influence disappeared and the impact of prior technological knowledge also decreased, indicating that TPCK and school policy were the strongest factors affecting educator's technology integration. To improve the use and effectiveness of technologically integrated curriculum, HPEs' in-service programs could focus on technology integration training to enhance educators' TPCK. The risk of technical issues and the need to invest extra time in the preparation process are obstacles to technical integration for authors. Therefore, schools can provide educators with relevant resources and support, and encourage them to interact with colleagues to enhance their confidence in technology integration. Although TPCK is a specialized, highly applied type of knowledge that supports content-based technology integration, it still has limitations, such as the inability to describe the more fluid processes that happen as educators work with students. </p>
